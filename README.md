***A simple yet elegant and progressive PHP Framework.***

---

Claritie allows developers to focus on business logic rather than the framework itself with the ease of forward-thinking. In a nutshell - *worry less about infrastructure and more about development!*

Let's forget all these fancy infrastructure labelings (such as controllers, models, repositories, entities, views, middlewares, components, containers, providers, facades, contracts, drivers, etc) and get right into application development while using MVC still.

And if you want, feel free to learn these advance concepts and implement them as you go!

Claritie is not the most advanced MVC framework there is, but rather progressive! It's the fastest to pick up and is ideal for quick and rapid development with little to no learning curve. Creating an ideal initial MVC framework for developers.

Including, Claritie does interrupt the global namespace in PHP but is highly modular and extensive.
